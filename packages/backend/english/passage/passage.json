    "passage 1":"So Jake spread his arms leaped skyward from the sidewalk, and began to fly, rocketing up over theneighborhood Suddenly he heard the distant voice of his father calling, as if from another universe and Jake pried open sleep-heavy eyes . . .“Get up, pal,” said Jake’s father, “or you’ll miss the school bus.” “Just let me sleep a little longer,” Jake mumbled. Then he groaned and turned over, pulling the covers up over his head like a tent, as if to somehow recapture his dream. Jake loved to sleep. It wasn’t that he was lazy or lacked energy. Jake was a normal fourteen-year-old kid in every way. But  he loved to curl up under a soft white cloud of sheets, rest his head on a marshmallow pillow, and luxuriate in the twilight world of slumber where life is exciting and dreams always come true.  So Jake was sitting at a table at Chez Maurice’s in Hollywood, having lunch with his buddy, Tom  Cruise. Tom was offering Jake a role in his next movie when . . .  “Get up,” said Jake’s father, gently shaking his son’s shoulders. Jake yawned and hauled his legs  over the side of the mattress, where he sat for a few moments to reconcile himself with the shocking   reality of upright existence. He dragged himself into the shower, where he briefly dreamed of tropical  rain forests, and at last shuffled downstairs to breakfast.“Jake’s going to sleep his life away!” teased Taylor, his nine-year-old sister, as she sat at the table,  kicking her dangling legs excitedly as if to show by comparison how wide awake she was.  “He’s just a growing boy,” said Jake’s father, washing dishes at the kitchen sink. “Right?” Jake  nodded sleepily and finished his breakfast. He trudged out the front door with Taylor, still halfsleepwalking, and they waited on the curb for their school bus, as usual.  At school, finally fully awake, Jake cycled through the pleasant routine of another typical day. He  greeted his buddy Benjamin at the locker they shared. They discussed hockey games and books. Then  there was science with Mr. Albert, math with Ms. Freed, and lunch with Benjamin, who always told  great jokes. After school, there was homework, dinner with his dad and Taylor, maybe a little TV, and  then off to dreamland. And so went week after week, and month after month.   So Jake swung the bat, sending the ball out of Dodger Stadium and into the Baseball Hall of  Fame . . .  “Come on, get up,” giggled Taylor, holding a ringing alarm clock only inches from her brother’s  face. “You’ll be late for school!” Jake shook his head in disbelief and ducked under the covers.  Moments later Jake awakened to an empty, quiet room. He noted with puzzlement that all the buttons on his pajama top had popped off in the night. Then he pulled himself from bed and padded  sleepily to the shower. The bathroom mirror reflected a face that was oddly unfamiliar—one with  heavier eyebrows and new creases in its brow. Jake rubbed a hand over his face and felt the  unexpected sandpaper abrasion of whiskers. Mystified and dazed, he staggered downstairs to the  kitchen, where he was shocked to discover a teenaged Taylor sitting at the breakfast table beside his  father, who was grayer and heavier."
